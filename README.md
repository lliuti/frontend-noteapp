# NOTEAPP
This is my first fullstack app. The idea is quite simple: take notes. But for it, you must be registered and signed in

### How to run it
To execute the frontend you must run:
```
npm install
```
or
```
yarn
```

### Backend
In order to see the app working properly you must launch the API as well. You can find it here: https://github.com/lliuti/backend-noteapp/

## Built with React
